# calvary-erp

This application was generated using JHipster 8.0.0-beta.2, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.0.0-beta.2](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v8.0.0-beta.2).

## Project Structure

Node is required for generation and recommended for development. `package.json` is always generated for a better development experience with prettier, commit hooks, scripts and so on.

In the project root, JHipster generates configuration files for tools like git, prettier, eslint, husky, and others that are well known and you can find references in the web.

`/src/*` structure follows default Java structure.

- `.yo-rc.json` - Yeoman configuration file
  JHipster configuration is stored in this file at `generator-jhipster` key. You may find `generator-jhipster-*` for specific blueprints configuration.
- `.yo-resolve` (optional) - Yeoman conflict resolver
  Allows to use a specific action when conflicts are found skipping prompts for files that matches a pattern. Each line should match `[pattern] [action]` with pattern been a [Minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#minimatch) pattern and action been one of skip (default if ommited) or force. Lines starting with `#` are considered comments and are ignored.
- `.jhipster/*.json` - JHipster entity configuration files

- `npmw` - wrapper to use locally installed npm.
  JHipster installs Node and npm locally using the build tool by default. This wrapper makes sure npm is installed locally and uses it avoiding some differences different versions can cause. By using `./npmw` instead of the traditional `npm` you can configure a Node-less environment to develop or test your application.
- `/src/main/docker` - Docker configurations for the application and services that the application depends on

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
npm install
```

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
./mvnw
npm start
```

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('./service-worker.js').then(function () {
      console.log('Service Worker Registered');
    });
  }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save --save-exact leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

```
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet
```

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### JHipster Control Center

JHipster Control Center can help you manage and control your application(s). You can start a local control center server (accessible on http://localhost:7419) with:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-control-center.yml up
```

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the calvary-erp application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
java -jar target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
```

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

```
npm test
```

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off forced authentication redirect for UI in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

Additionally, Instead of passing `sonar.password` and `sonar.login` as CLI arguments, these parameters can be configured from [sonar-project.properties](sonar-project.properties) as shown below:

```
sonar.login=admin
sonar.password=admin
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
npm run java:docker
```

Or build a arm64 docker image when using an arm64 processor os like MacOS with M1 processor family running:

```
npm run java:docker:arm64
```

Then run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

When running Docker Desktop on MacOS Big Sur or later, consider enabling experimental `Use the new Virtualization framework` for better processing performance ([disk access performance is worse](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/7)).

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.

## Building a Comprehensive Accounting System for a Church: A Deep Dive into the Reporting Module and Project Objectives

### Introduction:

In the ever-changing landscape of modern technology, organizations are increasingly adopting advanced systems to streamline their operations and enhance efficiency. This article delves into the technical aspects of a project aimed at developing a sophisticated ERP-like accounting system for a church. The project's primary focus is on the implementation of a robust reporting module that provides accurate and up-to-date financial information to the church's stakeholders.

##### Project Objectives and Goals:

The main objectives of this project are twofold: first, to develop an all-encompassing accounting system that adheres to the cardinal rule of double-entry accounting, and second, to create a flexible and reliable reporting module. The system should cater to the specific requirements of a church, addressing their unique needs for managing finances, tracking contributions, authorizing expenses, and generating accurate financial statements.

`Double-Entry Accounting Compliance:`
The foundation of this accounting system lies in its adherence to the double-entry accounting principle. Each financial transaction is meticulously recorded in a manner that ensures that debits equal credits, thus maintaining the financial equilibrium. By enforcing this rule throughout the system, the church can have confidence in the accuracy and reliability of its financial records.

`Flexible and Comprehensive Reporting:`
The reporting module is designed to be both flexible and comprehensive, providing users with access to a wide array of financial reports. This includes standard financial statements like the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and trial balance. Moreover, it encompasses specialized reports such as the cash flow statement, designed to depict the movement of cash over specific periods. The reporting framework enables users to customize the reports based on various criteria and timeframes, empowering them to gain valuable insights into the church's financial health.

##### Technical Aspects of the Reporting Module:

The reporting module is powered by a combination of front-end technologies and back-end data processing. On the front-end, the system utilizes ReactJS, offering enhanced flexibility and real-time data visualization capabilities through the Redux system. React Query or Axios facilitates seamless communication with the backend through APIs.

On the back-end, Java with the JHipster platform takes center stage. JHipster offers a standardized and best-practice implementation of the system, generating services, repositories, and API resources based on entity definitions. The integration with Hibernate allows for effective data management and synchronization between the application and the database.

The reporting module functions through a message queue system, which offers numerous benefits. It decouples the report generation process from immediate transaction processing, ensuring data consistency and efficient resource allocation. Consumers subscribed to the message queue process transactions in a sequential and orderly manner, updating the reports in real-time without affecting immediate system performance.

#### Conclusion:

The comprehensive accounting system being developed for the church encompasses a robust reporting module that meets the unique needs of a faith-based organization. By enforcing the double-entry accounting principle, maintaining data accuracy, and offering flexible reporting options, the system ensures that church administrators, auditors, and stakeholders have access to reliable and real-time financial information. By harnessing the power of ReactJS, Java, and the message queue system, this project aims to create an integrated ERP-like solution that simplifies financial management, streamlines operations, and empowers the church to make informed decisions that align with its mission and goals.
